# SrcMod

## About
SrcMod is a command-line [Source Engine](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) modding tool. It's currently in alpha development and will be developed further in the future.

SrcMod is a tool I originally decided to make so I wouldn't have to do all of the setup and finicky stuff required to develop a Source Engine mod. It runs its own shell and has a set of commands that can be entered. This tool is expected to near a working product by the beginning of summer. No promises though.

## Roadmap
I don't have any specific deadlines for anything but the first official release, which will *hopefully* be around the beginning of summer. However, currently the shell is in a state where no actual modding functionality is implemented and it's just a super simple shell. During the alpha releases, it will remain that way. When modding functionality is finally added, the development will shift into beta development.

In the official releases, an installer will accompany the shell, but in the alpha and beta releases the shell will have to be installed manually. The exact directory of the shell doesn't particularly matter.

More to come!
